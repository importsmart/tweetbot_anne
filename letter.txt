[Letter 1]
IN turning over in my
mind the contents of
your last letters, I have
put myself into great
agony, not knowing how to interpret
them, whether to my disadvantage,
as you show in some places, or to my
advantage, as I understand them in
some others, beseeching you earnestly
to let me know expressly your whole
mind as to the love between us two.

It is absolutely necessary for me to
obtain this answer, having been for
above a whole year stricken with the
dart of love, and not yet sure whether
I shall fail of finding a place in your
heart and afFeftion, which last point
has prevented me for some time past
from calling you my mistress; be-
cause, if you only love me with an
ordinary love, that name is not suit-
able for you, because it denotes a sin-
gular love, which is far from com-
mon. But if you please to do the office
of a true loyal mistress and friend, and
to give up yourself body and heart to
me, who will be, and have been, your
most loyal servant, (if your rigour
does not forbid me) I promise you
that not only the name shall be given
you, but also that I will take you
for my only mistress, casting off all
others besides you outof my thoughts
and afFeftions, and serve you only. I
beseech you to give an entire answer
to this my rude letter, that I may
know on what and how far I may
depend. And if it does not please
you to answer me in writing, appoint
some place where I may have it by
word of mouth, and I will go thither
with all my heart. No more, for fear
of tiring you. Written by the hand
of him who would willingly remain
yours, H. R.
\l
[Letter 2]
THOUGH it is not fitting for a
gentleman to take his lady in
the place of a servant, yet, complying
with your desire, I willingly grant it
you, if thereby you can find yourself
less uncomfortable in the place chosen
by yourself, than you have been in
that which I gave you, thanking you
cordially that you are pleased still to
have some remembrance of me.

[Letter 3]
ALTHOUGH, my Mistress, it
has not pleased you to remem-
ber the promise you made me when I
was last with you — that is, to hear
good news from you, and to have an
answer to my last letter; yet it seems
to me that it belongs to a true servant
(seeing that otherwise he can know
nothing) to inquire the health of his
mistress, and to acquit myself of the
duty of a true servant, I send you this
letter, beseeching you to apprise me
of your welfare, which I pray to God
may continue as long as I desire mine
own. And to cause you yet oftener
to remember me, I send you, by the
bearer of this, a buck killed late last
night by my own hand, hoping that
when you eat of it you may think of
the hunter; and thus, for want of
room, I must end my letter, written
by the hand of your servant, who very
often wishes for you instead of your
brother. H. R.
\l
[Letter 4]
MY MISTRESS & FRIEND,
my heart and I surrender our-
selves into your hands, beseeching
you to hold us commended to your
favour, and that by absence your af-
feftion to us may not be lessened:
for it were a great pity to increase
our pain, of which absence produces
enough and more than I could ever
have thought could be felt, remind-
ing us of a point in astronomy which
is this: the longer the days are, the
more distant is the sun, and never-
theless the hotter; so is it with our
love, for by absence we are kept a
distance from one another, and yet
it retains its fervour, at least on my
side; I hope the like on yours, as-
suring you that on my part the pain
of absence is already too great for
me; and when I think of the increase
of that which I am forced to suffer,
it would be almost intolerable, but
for the firm hope I have of your un-
changeable affedtion for me: and to
remind you of this sometimes, and
seeing that I cannot be personally
present with you, I now send you the
nearest thing I can to that, namely,
my picture set in a bracelet, with the
whole of the device, which you al-
ready know, wishing myself in their
place, if it should please you. This is
from the hand of your loyal servant
and friend,
H.R.

[Letter 5]
FOR a present so beautiful that
nothing could be more so (con-
sidering the whole of it), I thank you
most cordially, not only on account
of the fine diamond and the ship in
which the solitary damsel is tossed
about, but chiefly for the fine inter-
pretation and the too humble sub-
mission which your goodness hath
used towards me in this case; for I
think it would be very difficult for
me to find an occasion to deserve it,
if I were not assisted by your great
humanity and favour, which I have
always sought to seek, and will seek
to preserve by all the kindness in my
power, in which my hope has placed
its unchangeable intention, which
says, Aut illic, aut nullibi.

The demonstrations of your affec-
tion are such, the beautiful mottoes
of the letter so cordially expressed,
that they oblige me for ever to hon-
our, love, and serve you sincerely, be-
seeching you to continue in the same
firm and constant purpose, assuring
you that, on my part, I will surpass
it rather than make it reciprocal, if
loyalty of heart and a desire to please
you can accomplish this.

I beg, also, if at any time before this
I have in anyway offended you, that
you would give me the same abso-
lution that you ask, assuring you, that
henceforward my heart shall be de-
dicated to you alone. I wish my per-
son was so too. God can do it, if He
pleases, to whom I pray every day for
that end, hoping that at length my
prayers will be heard. I wish the time
may be short, but I shall think it
long till we see one another.

tary, who in heart, body, and will, is,

[Letter 6]
TO MY MISTRESS. Because
the time seems very long since
I heard concerning your health and
you, the great afFeftion I have for
you has induced me to send you this
bearer, to be better informed of your
health and pleasure, and because,
since my parting from you, I have
been told that the opinion in which
I left you is totally changed, and that
you would not come to court either
with your mother, if you could, or in
any other manner; which report, if
true, I cannot sufficiently marvel at,
because I am sure that I have since
never done any thing to offend you,
and it seems a very poor return for the
great love which I bear you to keep
me at a distance both from the speech
and the person of the woman that I
esteem most in the world: and if you
love me with as much affection as I
hope you do, I am sure that the dis-
tance of our two persons would be
a little irksome to you, though this
does not belong so much to the mis-
tress as to the servant.

Consider well, my mistress, that
absence from you grieves me sorely,
hoping that it is not your will that
it should be so; but if I knew for cer-
tain that you voluntarily desired it,
I could do no other than mourn my
ill-fortune, and by degrees abate my
great folly. And so, for lack of time,
I make an end of this rude letter, be-
seeching you to give credence to this
bearer in all that he will tell you
from me.

tire Servant,

[Letter 7]
DARLING, these shall be
only to advertise you that this
bearer and his fellow be despatched
with as many things to compass our
matter, and to bring it to pass as our
wits could imagine or devise; which
brought to pass, as I trust, by their
diligence, it shall be shortly, you and
I shall have our desired end, which
should be more to my heart’s ease,
and more quietness to my mind, than
any other thing in the world ; as, with
God’s grace, shortly I trust shall be
proved, but not so soon as I would
it were; yet I will ensure you that
there shall be no time lost that may
be won, and further can not be done;
for ultra posse non est esse*. Keep him
not too long with you, but desire
him, for your sake, to make the more
speed; for the sooner we shall have
word from him, the sooner shall our
matter come to pass. And thus upon
trust of your short repair to London,
I make an end of my letter, my own
sweet heart.

which desireth as much to be yours
as you do to have him.

[Letter 8]
THERE came to me suddenly
in the night the most afflict-
ing news that could have arrived.
The first, to hear of the sickness of
my mistress, whom I esteem more
than all the world, and whose health
I desire as I do my own, so that I
would gladly bear half your illness to
make you well. The second, from the
fear that I have of being still longer
harassed by my enemy. Absence,
much longer, who has hitherto given
me all possible uneasiness, and as far
as I can judge is determined to spite
me more because I pray God to rid
me of this troublesome tormentor.
The third, because the physician in
whom I have most confidence, is ab-
sent at the very time when he might
do me the greatest pleasure; for I
should hope, by him and his means,
to obtain one of my chief joys on
earth — that is the care of my mis-
tress — yet for want of him I send you
my second, and hope that he will
soon make you well. I shall then love
him more than ever. I beseech you
to be guided by his advice in your
illness. In so doing I hope soon to see
you again, which will be to me a
greater comfort than all the precious
jewels in the world.

and for ever will be, your loyal and
most assui’ed Servant,

[Letter 9]
THE uneasiness my doubts about
your health gave me, disturbed
and alarmed me exceedingly, and I
should not have had any quiet with-
out hearing certain tidings. But now,
since you have as yet felt nothing, I
hope, and am assured that it will spare
you, as I hope it is doing with us. For
when we were at Walton, two ush-
ers, two valets de chambres and your
brother, master-treasurer, fell ill, but
are now quite well ; and since we have
returned to our house at Hunsdon,
we have been perfedlly well, and have
not, at present, one sick person, God
be praised; and I think, if you would
retire from Surrey, as we did, you
would escape all danger. There is
another thing that may comfort you,
which is, that, in truth in this dis-
temper few or no women have been
taken ill, and what is more, no per-
son of our court, and few elsewhere,
have died of it. For which reason I
beg you, my entirely beloved, not to
frighten yourself nor be too uneasy at
our absence; for wherever I am, I am
yours, and yet we must sometimes
submit to our misfortunes, for who-
ever will struggle against fate is gen-
erally but so much the farther from
gaining his end: wherefore comfort
yourself, and take courage and avoid
the pestilence as much as you can,
for I hope shortly to make you sing,
la renvoyé. No more at present, from
lack of time, but that I wish you in
my arms, that I might a little dispel
your unreasonable thoughts.

[Letter 10]
THE cause of my writing at this
time, good sweetheart, is only
to understand of your good health
and prosperity; whereof to know I
would be as glad as in manner mine
own, praying God that (an it be His
pleasure) to send us shortly together,
for I promise you I long for it. How
be it, I trust it shall not be long to;
and seeing my darling is absent, I can
do no less than to send her some flesh,
representing my name, which is hart
flesh for Henry, prognosticating that
hereafter, God willing, you may en-
joy some of mine, which He pleased,
I would were now.

As touching your sister’s matter, I
have caused Walter Welze to write
to my lord my mind therein, whereby
I trust that Eve shall not have power
to deceive Adam; for surely, whatso-
ever is said, it cannot so stand with his
honour but that he must needs take
her, his natural daughter, now in her
extreme necessity.

No more to you at this time, mine
own darling, but that with a wish I
would we were together an evening.

With the hand of yours,

H.R.

[Letter 11]
SINCE your last letters, mine own
darling, Walter Welshe, Master
Browne, Thos. Care, Grion of Brear-
ton, and John Coke, the apothecary,
be fallen of the sweat in this house,
and, thanked be God, all well recov-
ered, so that as yet the plague is not
fully ceased here, but I trust shortly
it shall. By the mercy of God, the rest
of us yet be well, and I trust shall
pass it, either not to have it, or, at the
least, as easily as the rest have done.
As touching the matter of Wilton,
my lord cardinal hath had the nuns
before him, and examined them, Mr.
Bell being present ; which hath certi-
fied me that, for a truth, she had con-
fessed herself (which we would have
had abbess) to have had two children
by two sundry priests; and, further,
since hath been kept by a servant of
the Lord Broke that was, and that not
long ago. Wherefore I would not,for
all the gold in the world, clog your
conscience nor mine to make her ruler
of a house which is of so ungodly de-
meanour; nor, I trust, you would not
that neither for brother nor sister, I
should so destain mine honour or con-
science. And, as touching the prior-
ess, or Dame Eleanor’s eldest sister,
though there is not any evident case
proved against them, and that the
prioress is so old that for many years
she could not be as she was named;
yet notwithstanding, to do you plea-
sure,! have done that neither of them
shall have it, but that some other
good and well-disposed woman shall
have it, whereby the house shall be
the better reformed (whereof I en-
sure you it had much need), and God
much the better served.

As touching your abode at Hever,
do therein as best shall like you, for
you best know what air doth best with
you; but I would it were come there-
to (if it pleased God), that neither of
us need care for that, for I ensure you
I think it long. Suche is fallen sick
of the sweat, and therefore I send you
this bearer, because I think you long
to hear tidings from us, as we do like-
wise from you.

[Letter 12]
THE approach of the time for
which I have so long waited
rejoices me so much, that it seems
almost to have come already. How-
ever, the entire accomplishment can-
not be till the two persons meet,
which meeting is more desired by
me than anything in this world; for
what joy can be greater upon earth
than to have the company of her who
is dearest to me, knowing likewise
that she does the same on her part,
the thought of which gives me the
greatest pleasure.

Judge wh at an effect the presence of
that person must have on me, whose
absence has grieved my heart more
than either words or writing can ex-
press, and which nothing can cure,
but that begging you, my mistress, to
tell your father from me, that I de-
sire him to hasten the time appointed
by two days, that he may be at court
before the old term, or, at farthest, on
the day prefixed; for otherwise I shall
think he will not do the lover’s turn,
as he said he would, nor answer my
expectation.

No more at present for lack of
time, hoping shortly that byword of
mouth I shall tell you the rest of the
sufferings endured by mc from your
absence.

tary, who wishes himself at this mo-
ment privately with you, and who is,

DARLING, I heartily recom-
mend me to you, ascertaining
you that I am not a little perplexed
with such things as your brother
shall on my part declare unto you,
to whom I pray you give full cre-
dence, for it were too long to write.
In my last letters I writ to you that
I trusted shortly to see you, which
is better known at London than with
any that is about me, whereof I not
a little marvel; but lack of discreet
handling must needs be the cause
thereof. No more to you at this time,
but that I trust shortly our meetings
shall not depend upon other men’s
light handlings, but upon our own.

longeth to be yours.

MINE own SWEETHEART,
this shall be to advertise you
of the great elengeness that I find here
since your departing ; for, I ensure you
methinketh the time longer since
your departing now last, than I was
wont to do a whole fortnight. I think
your kindness and my fervency of love
causeth it ; for, otherwise, I would not
have thought it possible that for so
little a while it should have grieved
me. But now that I am coming to-
wards you, methinketh my pains be
half removed ; and also I am right well
comforted in so much that my book
maketh substantially for my matter;
in looking whereof I have spent above
four hours this day, which causeth me
now to write the shorter letter to you
at this time, because of some pain in
my head; wishing myself (especially
an evening) in my sweetheart’s arms,
whose pretty dukkys I trust shortly
to kiss.

[Letter 15]
DARLING, Though I have
scant leisure, yet, remember-
ing my promise, I thought it con-
venient to certify you briefly in what
case our affairs stand. As touching
a lodging for you, we have got one
by my lord cardinal’s means, the like
whereof could not have been found
hereabouts for all causes, as this bearer
shall more show you. As touching our
other affairs, I assure you there can
be no more done, nor more diligence
used, nor all manner of dangers bet-
ter both foreseen and provided for, so
that I trust it shall be hereafter to both
our comforts, the specialities whereof
were both too long to be written, and
hardly by messenger to be declared.
Wherefore, till you repair hither, I
keep something in store, trusting it
shall not be long to; for I have caused
my lord, your father, to make his pro-
visions with speed; and thus for lack
of time, darling, I make an end of my
letter, written with the hand of him
which I would were yours.

[Letter 16]
THE reasonable request of your
last letter, with the pleasure also
that I take to know them true, caus-
eth me to send you these news. The
legate which we most desire arrived
at Paris on Sunday or Monday last
past, so that I trust by the next Mon-
day to hear of his arrival at Calais:
and then I trust within a while after
to enjoy that which I have so long
longed for, to God’s pleasure and our
both comforts.

No more to you at this present,
mine own darling, for lack of time,
but that I would you were in mine
arms, or I in yours, for I think it long
since I kissed you.

Written after the killing of a hart,

[Letter 17]
To inform you what joy it is to
me to understand of your con-
formableness with reason, and of the
suppressing of your inutile and vain
thoughts with the bridle of reason. I
assure you all the good in this world
could not counterpoise for my satis-
fadtion the knowledge and certainty
thereof, wherefore, good sweetheart,
continue the same, not only in this,
but in all your doings hereafter; for
thereby shall come, both to you and
me, the greatest quietness that may
be in this world.

The cause why the bearer stays so
long, is the business I have had to
dress up gear for you; and which I
trust, ere long to cause you occupy :
then I trust to occupy yours, which
shall be recompense enough to me
for all my pains and labour.

The unfeigned sickness of this well-
willing legate doth somewhat retard
his access to your person; but I trust
verily, when God shall send him
health, he will with diligence recom-
pense his demur. For I know well
where he hath said (touching the say-
ing and bruit that he is thought im-
perial) that it shall be well known in
this matter that he is not imperial;
and thus, for lack of time, sweetheart,
farewell.

Written with the hand which fain
would be yours, and so is the heart.
